# Example: Multi-environment CI/CD with gistenv
# This workflow demonstrates deploying to different environments based on branch or manual selection.
#
# Your Gist should have sections for each environment:
#   # [Development]
#   API_KEY=dev_key
#   # [Staging]
#   API_KEY=staging_key
#   # [Production]
#   API_KEY=prod_key
